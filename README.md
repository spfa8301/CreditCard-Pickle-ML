# CreditCard-Pickle-ML
# Lab -- Pickling ML Models Learning objectives: 
at the completion of the next few labs, have done all of the following: 
Fit a ML model pipeline, and pickle it. 
Create a Flask app that loads the pickled model pipeline. 
Create a Flask route that receives a JSON request with new data, and returns a prediction for the new data fed against the model. 
Run and test the flask app locally. Deploy the flask app to a heroku dyno, and test it there.

## Learning objectives for this mini-lab:
Fit a ML model pipeline, and pickle it.
Save some newdata to a file that you can use later for testing your deployed model
Ambidextrously use both jupyter notebooks and straight python files.
Keep in mind!

Do all work for this and the next few labs in a virtual environment.
Each time you need to install a new python package within your environment, add the package to a file called requirements.txt
The examples below will use the creditcard fraud dataset, but for your deliverable, you should use your own project dataset.
